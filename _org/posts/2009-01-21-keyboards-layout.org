* Why my keyboard has a QWERTY layout?

The most common keyboard layout in use today is called QWERTY, it
takes its name from the first six characters seen in the far left of
the keyboard's top row of letters.

** Why QWERTY? why is it laid out this way?

from Wikipedia:

"The QWERTY layout was introduced in the 1860s, being used on the
first commercially-successful typewriter, the machine invented by
Christopher Sholes. The QWERTY layout was designed so that successive
keystrokes would alternate between sides of the keyboard so as to
avoid jams. Improvements in typewriter design made key jams less of a
problem."

*So the mechanical issues of the original typewriters was the main
 reason for this layout design.*

A second popular layout is called Dvorak, designed in the 1930's and
it tries to address another problem:

"...the introduction of the electric typewriter in the 1930s made
typist fatigue more of a problem, leading to increased interest in the
Dvorak layout..."

But even the Dvorak layout is already some years old, so is the
*typist fatigue* the same as now? Do we write, for example, the same
things as in 1930's? 

** Is there a better layout?

Take a look at the texts you write every day, and imagine if changing
the keyboard would make it more practical for you.

For example, for this text i had to write the word WHY a lot ;) so if
i had whyrtu instead of qwerty on my keyboard, would be an
improvement...right? Maybe yes, but we have to take into
consideration a few of other things also, for example:
  - counting all the most used words. 
  - minimize vertical movements, like jumping up and down on keys rows.
  - minimize horizontal movements, can cause hitting 2 successive keys
  - frequent use of pinky.
  - etc... (you can make up your own)

And then try out several keyboard layouts and variations.

Imagining to do this by hand, like Dvorak and Sholes
did for QWERTY is a pain. Luckily we have computers now and as a
matter of fact someone already played around with this problem (which
made think about all this subject in the first place).

** Your Own keyboard

I'm not sure that there is 1 ultimate and perfect keyboard for
everyone, because depends so much on the words you write more
frequently, and:
- different people use words in different ways.
- different languages make for completely different words.
- 15 years old person words are different from a 70 years old person
  words.
- use of computer during working hours compared out-of-work working
  hours...
- etc...

So even for you, an optimal keyboard layout would probably change over
time.

But imagine a future intelligent computer that can be all the time
analyzing what you write in the keyboard and can auto-adapt itself to
give your own very optimal layout. Not too frequently, of course, you
don' want your keyboard changing every day. But maybe every 2 years is
not so impossible to imagine...

Keyboards of the future should come with blank keys that
can be personalized with the character you want.

How would this work is someone changes computer? every time you
login(just by touching, with fingerprint id) into a different
computer, your keyboard configuration is pulled from internet.

Another idea, is to have full words on keys, like with your top 5 most
used words.


Or have touch screens, and have a keyboard appear on a touch screen,
A keyboard on a touch screen is whole new level of layout
possibilities, we could make more frequent keys bigger than
others... play with different keyboard shapes, that can adapt to each
person real hands sizes for example... etc... etc...
