### Precepts of Work

- Working on something relevant in 1-5 year? What world problem does it solve?
- Learn from / Follow the top success people in the field
- Are are you contributing something back to the ecosystem that is helping you?
- Build(& dont burn) bridges. Cultivate friendships.
- Allocate time to learn.
- Allocate time for the slow but long-term important work. Don't be trapped by the urgent short-term rat-race tasks.
- Don't work too much.
- Say what you think =Be Assertive.
- Have always a little challenge, never be too comfortable. too comfortable > laziness > no learning.
- Be humble, but try keep a good balance between humble and over confident.

### Precepts of Productivity

  - Brain dump, write down a todo list, define priorities, pick the one at the top and forget about them, don't keep worrying about things. (see Kanban, GTD)
    - Set notifications to remind important things (google calendar or outlook.com)
  - Kill notifications that can interrups: email / IM are a major source of distraction, schedule times for it, don't be driven by it (is better to drive it)
  - Block quiet time (for a Maker's agenda see reference)
  - Avoid Multitasking. Adds the overhead of context switching that drains attention / energy from the tasks at hand, same problem with meetings interrupting work.
  - Brain gets tired as day goes by (some say only 4-5 hours of full on concentration)
  - Exercise (even just 20 mins, even walking), greatly boosts productivity.
  - Health in general, and lack of sleep play a big role in productivity.
  - Keep a done list - when time is spent on something (> 30mins), write it down in a done list, per day, a quick 1 line description. This helps to avoid getting to end of week without remembering where the time went, great for postmortem analysis. - Seinfeld method, look at what has has been done and incentivates to keep it up.
  - Track how you work, pick up weak points & time wasters, AB test / experiment for a week alternatives way of working (less mail or no IM, or no internet, etc...) and compare productivity. (tools: manictime, rescuetime, etc...)

### Getting Things Done

1. Write down all the stuf to achieve an empty mind from worries
2. Review the written list, for each item
  - what is the next step to do?
  - if not actionable delete it (and save as reference).
  - less then 2 mins then do it!
  - longer than 2 mins defer for later into TODO list (defer tool: calendar reminders)
- Organize the TODO list by priority
- Do it


#### Tackling a project (a bigger task)

1. Purpose - the why 
2. Outcome visioning - what should look like / behave.
3. Brainstorm solutions
4. Organize what (components) needs to be tackled in what priority.
5. Identify next actions

### Tackling a Problem

- Step away from the computer for important problems, computer is a major source of distraction, the analysis & design phase is key to decide how to tackle the problem, focus and write it down - this is the loading up phase of Hammock Driven Development
- Don't do important tasks all in 1 go, accept first iteraction is not perfect. Ideally come back to it overnight - the background mind is better at synthesis, consolidating new information and making new associations.
- Hurrying often overlooks the fine details and introduces errors - sloppy work. Ideal is quick and no-dirty, but often this is not possible.
- Practice to recognize complexity and how to avoid it and simplify it. Break a complex thing into many simple / independent composable parts. It is easier to work with simple - See Simple-Made-Easy talk.

### Precepts of Tools

- Best tool for the job, a means to an end
- Make each program do 1 thing well
- Make each program a (standalone)filter    
- Be very familiar with just a few
- Tools will change / deprecate: Avoid investing too much into tools(because will as side-effect resist change in future)
- Prefer output to console instead of writing to file, easier to filter output, when used from other programs.
- Get it running ASAP =agile
- Do tests for important things, they can save you from trouble
- Math is a great tool

### My Current Tools of Choice

- These are likely to change a over time
- There is a lot of overlap between each tool but follow rule: choose the best tool for the job
- Use functional programming principles in the language chosen for the task.
- More important than tool is to know and apply good practices.

- Ruby - quick scripting
- Clojure - applications
- R - number crunching, trying out algorithms
- Javascript - mandatory because of browser
- Excel - data analysis(EDA), data dashboard prototypes
- Powerpoint - Infographics & story telling
- Math - stats, probability
