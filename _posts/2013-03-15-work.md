  - Are are you contributing something back to the ecosystem that is helping you?
  - Build(& dont burn) bridges. Cultivate friendships.
  - Allocate time to learn.

  - Don't work too much.
  - Say what you think =Be Assertive.
  - Have always a little challenge, never be too comfortable. too comfortable > laziness > no learning.

### Precepts of Productivity

  - Brain gets tired as day goes by(some say only 4-5 hours of full on concentration)
  - Brain dump, write down a todo list, define priorities and forget about them, don't keep worrying about things.
  - Kill all notifications: email / IM are a major source of distraction, schedule times for it, don't be driven by it (is better to drive it)
  - Schedule your priorities - check goals, define what needs to happen first, block time in calendar for priorities - E.g. at start of day, review todo list and define what is the most important things to tackle that day.
  - Multitasking is bad. Sounds fancy, but adds the overhead of context switching that drains attention / energy from the tasks at hand.
  - Sport(even just 20 mins, even walking), greatly boosts productivity.
  - Step away from the computer for important problems, computer is a major source of distraction, the analysis & design phase is key to decide how to tackle the problem, focus and write it down - this is the loading up phase of Hammock Driven Development
  - Don't do important tasks all in 1 go, ideally come back to it overnight - the background mind is better at synthesis, consolidating new information and making new associations.
  - Hurrying often overlooks the fine details and introduces errors - sloppy work. Ideal is quick and no-dirty, but often this is not possible.
  - Health in general, lack of sleep are play a big role in productivity.
  - Keep a done list - when time is spent on something (> 30mins), write it down in a done list, per day, a quick 1 line description. This helps to avoid getting to end of week without remembering where the time went, great for postmortem analysis.
  - Practice to recognize complexity and how to avoid it and simplify it. Break a complex thing into many simple / independent composable parts. It is easier to work with simple - See Simple-Made-Easy talk.

### Precepts of Tools

  - Best tool for the job, a means to an end
  - Make each program do 1 thing well
  - Make each program a (standalone)filter    
  - Be very familiar with just a few
  - Tools will change / deprecate: Avoid investing too much into tools(because will as side-effect resist change in future)
  - Prefer output to console instead of writing to file, easier to filter output, when used from other programs.
  - Get it running ASAP =agile
  - Do tests for important things, they can save you from trouble
  - Math is a great tool
