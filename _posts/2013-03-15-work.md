### Precepts of Work

  - Working on something relevant in 1-5 year? What world problem does it solve?
  - Don't ignore your dreams
  - Follow the top success people in the field
  - Are are you contributing something back to the ecosystem that is helping you?
  - Build(& dont burn) bridges. Cultivate friendships.
  - Allocate time to learn
  - Allocate time for the slow but long-term important work. Don't be trapped by the urgent short-term rat-race tasks.
  - Don't work too much
  - Say what you think =Be Assertive

### Precepts of Productivity

  - Brain gets tired as day goes by(some say only 4-5 hours of full on concentration)
  - Brain dump, write down a todo list, define priorities and forget about them, don't keep worring about things.
  - Kill all notifications: email / IM are a major source of distraction, schedule times for it, don't be driven by it (is better to drive it)
  - Schedule your priorities - check goals, define what needs to happen first, block time in calendar for priorities - E.g. at start of day, review todo list and define what is the most important things to tackle that day.
  - Multitasking is bad. Sounds fancy, but adds the overhead of context switching that drains attention / energy from the tasks at hand.
  - Sport(even just 20  mins), greatly boosts productivity.
  - Step away from the computer for important problems, computer is a major source of distraction, the analysis & design phase is key to decide how to tackle the problem, focus and write it down - this is the loading up phase of Hammock Driven Development
  - Don't do important tasks all in 1 go, ideally come back to it overnight - the background mind is better at synthesis, consolidating new information and making new associations.

### Precepts of Tools
  - Best tool for the job, a means to an end
  - Make each program do 1 thing well
  - Make each program a (standalone)filter    
  - Be very familiar with just a few
  - Tools will change / deprecate: Avoid investing too much into tools(becuase will as side-effect resist change in future)
  - Prefer output to console instead of writing to file, easier to filter output, when used from other programs.
  - Get it running ASAP =agile
  - Do tests for important things, they can save you from trouble
  - Math is a great tool
