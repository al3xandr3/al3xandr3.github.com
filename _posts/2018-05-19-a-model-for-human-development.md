Spiral Dynamics *by Clare W. Graves*

John is alone, hungry and looking for food. Still healing a wound from the last food chase. On the lookout for dangerous lions, every day is a battle for survival. [Beige]

<br/><br/>
*Some time after,* John finds a tribe, he is now fed and protected. Starts to cooperate with others and the tribe is stronger with John. [**Purple**]

<br/><br/>
*Some time after,* John sees another group having more food and easier life, he goes and takes it by force, group is now double bigger. John is an aggressive ruler, he lusts for power, needs to hold a proud image while constantly watching his back (because others want his place), "Machiavelli" is born, John's group constantly seeks more power and to overtake others. [**Red**]

<br/><br/>
*Some time after,* John's group is matched by an equally strong rival group, neither group can win. They agree to rules. Rules for peace, cooperation and equality. They get a functioning society that prospers. Rules became dogma. Different rules are wrong.  [**Blue**]

<br/><br/>
*Some time after, *John realizes these fixed rules take equality too far, we should reward more the individuals who figure out how to make something faster, cheaper and better. Competition is born, free markets and science. Rules and beliefs exist, but are superseded when better ones are found. Inequality among individuals starts to grow.  [**Orange**]

<br/><br/>
*Some time after,* The focus on individual achievements brings materialism, concentration of power and puts all the wealth in a small group, with the rest struggling. John decides to dial down individualism, rise empathy, strives for diversity and global equality. Even at the cost of slowing down (getting work done" takes longer).  [**Green**]

<br/><br/>
*Some time after,* Out of frustration of the inability (or slow pace) for solving the complex problems that humanity is faced with (the global consensus takes time and energy). John finds himself with the need to break out of the group and to offer his unique contribution in a complete independent and free way. John is an instrument for the greater whole (authentic systemic thinking), some goals are made that are unlikely to be seen in his lifetime. [**Yellow**]
