While watching these, one thing that striked me is that this logic
programming seems very similar to kind of things we use SQL for, just
better&hellip; more flexible.
</p>
<p>
<b>So why we do use SQL after all?</b>
</p>
<p>
After a bit of googling found this good article:
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/AI-Prolog/lib/AI/Prolog/Article.pod">http://search.cpan.org/dist/AI-Prolog/lib/AI/Prolog/Article.pod</a> one of
the references says:
</p>
<p>
"&hellip;So if prolog(read AI) and SQL(DB) are so similar, Why is one so
successful commercially and the other deemed A complete failure in
terms of scalability?&hellip;"
</p>
<p>
Databases implement powerful techniques to improve performance:
</p><ul>
<li>
Indexing
</li>
<li>
Hashing
</li>
<li>
Reordering goals to reduce backtracking
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Where as Prolog based systems have very few such techniques.
</p>
<p>
<b>So does have SQL have everything needed?</b>
</p>
<p>
One of the most powerful features of Prolog is recursion.
</p>
<p>
SQL does not have recursion built into it. This is a severe
Handicap. However there is a way to overcome this problem by invoking
multiple SQL queries from a host language like C Or JAVA. SQL3 has
begun supporting recursion.
