While watching the SICP lectures  8a &amp; 8b, one thing that i realized is that this logic programming they mention seems to be very similar to kind of things we use SQL for, just better&hellip; a lot more flexible.
</p>
<p>
<b>So why we do use SQL after all?</b>
</p>
<p>
After a bit of googling found this good article: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/AI-Prolog/lib/AI/Prolog/Article.pod">http://search.cpan.org/dist/AI-Prolog/lib/AI/Prolog/Article.pod</a> one of the references says:
</p>
<p>
"&hellip;So if Prolog(read AI) and SQL(DB) are so similar, Why is one so successful commercially and the other deemed a complete failure in terms of scalability?&hellip;"
</p>
<p>
Databases implement powerful techniques to improve performance:
</p><ul>
<li>Indexing
</li>
<li>Hashing
</li>
<li>Reordering goals to reduce backtracking
</li>
</ul>

<p>Where as Prolog based systems have very few such techniques.
</p>
<p>
<b>What is SQL missing?</b>
</p>
<p>
One of the most powerful features of Prolog is recursion.
</p>
<p>
SQL does not have recursion built into it. This is a severe Handicap. However there is a way to overcome this problem by invoking multiple SQL queries from a host language like C Or Java. SQL3 has begun supporting recursion.
