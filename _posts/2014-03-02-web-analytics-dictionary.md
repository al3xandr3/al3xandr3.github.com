Found some time ago the: http://www.webanalyticsdictionary.com/, which i like a lot as a source of web analytics definitions. 

There is no in-site search mechanism, which i found frustrating, but alternatively is possible to use google search:

    "Acknowledgement Page" site: www.webanalyticsdictionary.com

(as long as what you search for is already indexed by the google search engine)

Anyway, i decided to web scrape it for my own reference, and posting here if someone else finds it useful also.

( It could even be used to put on a memory repetition program like Anki, to help learning all the terms, and/or preparing for job interviews for example. )

## Web Scraping it

### Step 1. Download the Internet to your computer (or just the site in this case)

    wget --wait=2 -r -p -U Mozilla http://www.webanalyticsdictionary.com/

- To pause 2 seconds between retrievals: --wait 
- Tell the site you are using some commonly accepted browser: -p -U Mozilla
- Recursively fetch the site, that is linked pages from it : -r

### Step 2. Extract the data

Step one has made a local copy of the site. Now we need to extract the useful data from it:

    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import fnmatch
    import os
    import codecs

    out = codecs.open('webanalyticsdictionary.csv','w', encoding='utf-8')

    for root, dirs, files in os.walk("."):
        for filename in fnmatch.filter(files, "index.html"):
            print os.path.join(root, filename)
            f = open(os.path.join(root, filename), 'r')
            soup = BeautifulSoup(f.read())
            title = soup.select('.entry-title')
            content = soup.select('.entry-content')
            if title and content:
                print title[0].getText(), ",", 
                         content[0].getText().encode('ascii', 'ignore').replace('\n', ' ') + '\n'
                out.write(title[0].getText() + ",\"" +
                          content[0].getText().encode('ascii', 'ignore').replace('\n', ' ') + 
                          '\"\n')

I'm using the anaconda python all in one installation package to both install python and the libraries i need.

| Organic Search Listings | Listings that search engines do not sell (unlike paid listings). Instead, sites appear solely because a search engine has deemed it editorially important for them to be included, regardless of payment. Paid Inclusion Content is also often considered organic even though it is paid for. This is because paid inclusion content usually appears intermixed with unpaid organic results. |

| Browser | The software used to access a website. Examples of browsers include Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Netscape.  |
| Browser Cache (pronounced CASH) Cart Open | An application that provides a way to look at and interact with all the information on the World Wide Web (also called a Web browser). It is technically a client program (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) that uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to send requests to Web servers throughout the Internet on behalf of the user. A temporary storage location from which data can be retrieved. Data retrieval from cache is usually much faster than from the server. The Internet makes predominant use of the following two caching mechanisms: The Web browser stores recently downloaded pages in a temporary location on your hard drive. When you return to a page you've recently viewed, the browser quickly retrieves it from this local cache rather than the original server. You can usually change the size of your cache, depending on the browser you use. Most ISPs utilize caching servers on their network. When a browser requests a page, the page is downloaded to the individuals computer and also saved on the caching server. If a different user then requests the same page, it is then retrieved from one of the caching servers rather than the site servers. Many analysis tools (especially log file analyzers) fail to count page views from cached pages. SiteCatalysts proprietary cache-busting technology counts cached page views the same way it counts page views that have not been retrieved from cache, resulting in much more accurate Web site usage data. Events in which the cart object is created for a customer. Cart opens usually occur when a customer selects an item for purchase, but can occur without an item as well.  |

| Action | Actions performed by your visitors. If your actions are set to unique, then the Action metric shows the number of unique actions (e.g., if a visitor makes three purchases during a visit, only one unique action is counted). Otherwise, the action metric shows the total number of (non-unique) actions (e.g., if an action occurs more than once during a visit, it will be counted every time it occurs). |
| Certificate Signing Request (CSR) | A text file generated by the web server on which the SSL certificate will be installed. A Certificate Authority uses this text file to create a  "signed" SSL certificate.  |
| Clickstream | (alt. to click path) is the recording of what a computer user clicks on while Web browsing or using another software application. As the user clicks anywhere in the web page or application, the action is logged on a client or inside the Web server, as well as possibly the Web browser, routers, or ad servers. |
| Cookie | A cookie is a text file that uniquely identifies and is stored in the user's browser. Cookies are most commonly used to identify individuals and remember general user preferences. SiteCatalyst uses cookies both to differentiate requests from different browsers and to store helpful information that can be used by the application at a later time. In particular, SiteCatalyst uses cookies to anonymously define new visitors, help analyze click-stream data, and track historical activity on the web site such as response to particular campaigns or the length of the sales cycle.  |

| Dashboard Player | Omniture's Dashboard Player is a Flash-based tool that displays the reportlets from selected dashboards in slideshow fashion on your screen.  |
| Data Bloc | Data blocks are used in Excel Integration. They contain data that is taken from SiteCatalyst and posted to an Excel worksheet.  |
| Data Extract | Data extracts let you choose the parameters you will view on both the X- and Y-axes of the report, as well as the item by which the report will be filtered. For example, you could place products along the left side of the report, dates across the top, and a metric as the overall data filter. The Data Extracts are delivered reports, and are only available in CSV format.  |
| Data Feed | A data feed is a compressed (zipped) file containing traffic data for one report suite. If data feeds are enabled for multiple report suites, a separate data file is  sent for each report suite. Each compressed data feed file contains 13 tab delimited text files, each carrying a .tsv filename extension. One file contains traffic data and the  other files contain reference data.  |
| Data Sources Activation Wizard | Part of the Data Sources Manager that enables you to activate or deactivate existing Data Sources. See Data Sources Manager.  |

A submitted contact form is considered a lead. It contains personal information about a visitor who has some degree of interest in a product or service.  |
| Link Cardinality | See Link Popularity.  |
| Link Farming | The attempt to substantially and artificially increase link popularity.  |
| Link Popularity | Link popularity generally refers to the total number of links pointing to any particular URL. There are typically two types of link popularity: Internal and External. Internal link popularity typically refers to the number of links or pages within a web site that link to a specific URL. External link popularity refers to the number of inbound links from external web sites that are pointing to a specific URL. If you have more links than your competitors, you are typically known to have link cardinality or link superiority .  |
| Linkbait | Also known as link bait, this is something on your site that people will notice and link to. By linking to your site, other sites are saying they value the content of  your site and that they think other people will be interested in it, too.  |
| linkHandler Suite Plug-in | The linkHandler suite of plug-ins allows for easy detection of file download and exit links. It also provides insight into clicks to specific links without modifying the existing link code.  |
| Linking Profile | A profile is a representation of the extent to which something exhibits various characteristics. A linking profile is the result of an analysis of where your links are coming from.  |
| linkInternalFilters Variable | linkInternalFilters is an optional variable used in conjunction with linkExternalFilters to determine whether a link is an exit link.  |
| linkLeaveQueryString Variable | The linkLeaveQueryString variable determines whether or not the query string should be included on Exit Links and Download Links.  |
| linkName Variable | linkName is an optional variable used in Link Tracking that determines the name of a custom, download, or exit link.  |
| linkTrackEvents Variable | linkTrackEvents is a comma-separated list of events that may be sent with a custom, exit, or download link. If an event is not in linkTrackEvents, then it will not be sent to SiteCatalyst, even if it is populated in the onClick event of a link.  |
| Log File Analysis | The analysis of records stored in the log file. In its raw format, the data in the log files can be hard to read and overwhelming. There are numerous log file analyzers that convert log file data into user-friendly charts and graphs. A good analyzer is generally considered an essential tool in SEO because it can show search engine  statistics such as the number of visitors received from each search engine, the keywords each visitors used to find the site, visits by search engine spiders etc...  |
| Long-tailed Keywords | Keyword phrases with at least 2 or 3 words in them.  |
| Long Tail | Keyword phrases with at least three, sometimes four or five, words in them. These long tail keywords are usually highly specific and draw lower traffic than shorter, more competitive keyword phrases, which is why they are also cheaper. Often times, long tail keywords, in aggregate, have good conversion ratios for the low number of click throughs they generate.  |
| MapMyLead | This tool allows sales people to generate more leads from their websites. Most of the B2B sites have a conversion ratio of less than 2%. That means, you don't know who the remaining 98% is. MapMyLead helps our customers to know which companies are coming to their website and what they are doing. MapMyLead comes with advanced querying capabilities as well as a convenient scheduling feature to get data emailed on daily or weekly basis.  |
| Meta Feeds | Ad networks that pull advertiser listings from other providers. They may or may not have their own distribution and advertiser networks.  |

| Mod_rewrite | URL Rewrite processes, also known as mod rewrites, are employed when a webmaster decides to reorganize a current web site, either for the benefit of better user experience with a new directory structure or to clean up URLs which are difficult for search engines to index.  |
| Multivariate Testing |  Although A/B testing is useful, it has some limitations. Multivariate testing on the other hand can test combinations of multiple elements MVT testing can obtain dramatic results by varying online factors such as design, copy, images etc MVT testing can help you make the most of your site and get ahead of your competitors |
| Multivariate Testing | A type of testing that varies and tests more than one or two campaign elements at a time to determine the best performing elements and combinations.  Multivariate testing can gather significant results on many different components of, for example, alternative PPC ad titles or descriptions in a short period of time. Often it requires special expertise to analyze complex statistical results. (Compare to A/B Testing which changes only one element at a time, alternately serving an old version ad and a changed one.) In search advertising, you might do A/B Split or Multivariate testing to learn what parts of a landing page (background color, title, headline, fill in forms, design, images) produce higher conversions and are more cost effective.  |
| Naked Links | A posted and visible link in the text of a web page that directs to a web site.  |
| Negative Keywords | Filtered-out keywords to prevent ad serves on them in order to avoid irrelevant click-through charges on, for example, products that you do not sell, or to refine and narrow the targeting of your Ad Groups keywords. Microsoft adCenter calls them excluded keywords. Formatting negative keywords varies by search engine; but they are usually designated with a minus sign.  |
| Netscape Plug-ins | This SiteCatalyst report lets you learn which plug-ins are used by the visitors to your site (available only for Netscape). This information is especially useful if your web page has content that requires a specific plug-in.  |
| Network | A group of two or more computer systems linked together. There are many types of computer networks, including: Local-Area Networks (LANs), where the computers are geographically close together (in the same building). WideArea Networks (WANs), where the computers are farther apart and are connected by telephone lines or radio waves. Computers on a network are sometimes called nodes. Computers and devices that allocate resources for a network are called servers.  |
| % New Visits | Of all the visits to your site, what percentage of them came to your site for the first time. By itself, this is nearly useless. But, when paired with other stats it  can be illuminating. For example, lets compare the number of new visitors to the number of page views. If your new visitor count is high and continues to grow, but your page views remains constant that would tell you that while you are attracting visitors, they are not coming back.  |
| Next Page | SiteCatalyst report that provides detailed site path analysis by pinpointing where your visitors go within your site after leaving any given page on your site. For example if you want to find where your visitors go after your home page, this report will show you the top five pages your visitors go to after leaving your home page.  |
| Next Page Flow | SiteCatalyst report that graphically illustrates two levels of the most popular next pages that your visitors view following the selected page. The report also highlights when visitors exit your site.  |
| No Script Tag | The noscript element is used to define an alternate content (text) if a script is NOT executed. This tag is used for a browser that recognizes the < script > tag, but does not support the script in it.  |
| No Follow | No Follow is an attribute webmasters can place on links that tell search engines not to count the link as a vote or not to send any trust to that site. Search engines will follow the link, yet it will not influence search results. No Follows can be added to any link with this code: rel=nofollow.  |
| Optimization Testing | Testing is integral to the running of a successful website, as without experimenting, no one can tell what is really working.  |
| Organic Results | Listings on SERPs that were not paid for; listings for which search engines do not sell space. Sites appear in organic (also called natural) results because a search engine has applied formulas (algorithms) to its search crawler index, combined with editorial decisions and content weighting, that it deems important enough inclusion without payment. Paid Inclusion Content is also often considered organic even though it is paid advertising because paid inclusion content usually appears on SERPs mixed with unpaid, organic results.  |
| Organic Search Listings | Listings that search engines do not sell (unlike paid listings). Instead, sites appear solely because a search engine has deemed it editorially important for them to be included, regardless of payment. Paid Inclusion Contentis also often considered organic even though it is paid for. This is because paid inclusion content usually appears intermixed with unpaid organic results.  |
| Organic Search Rankings | Search engine ranking of web pages found in SERPs.  |
| Original Referrer | Customers can visit your site multiple times, and have a different referrer for each visit. The original referrer is the referrer customers used the first time they arrived at your site.  |
| P4P | Acronym for Pay for Performance, also designated as PFP. See alsoPPC Advertising.  |
| Revshare / RevenueSharing | A method of allocating per-click revenue to a site publisher, and click-through charges to a search engine that distributes paid-ads to its context network partners, for every page viewer who clicks on the content sites sponsored ads. |
| Podcasts | A podcast is a media file that is distributed over the internet using syndication feeds, for playback on portable media players and personal computers. Like 'radio,' it can mean both the content and the method of syndication. |
| Organic Search Listings | Listings that search engines do not sell (unlike paid listings). Instead, sites appear solely because a search engine has deemed it editorially important for them to be included, regardless of payment. |
| Meta Feeds | Ad networks that pull advertiser listings from other providers. They may or may not have their own distribution and advertiser networks. |
| Latent Semantic Indexing | LSI uses word associations to help search engines know more accurately what a page is about.  |
| PageRank (PR) | PR is the Google technology developed at Stanford University for placing importance on pages and web sites. At one point, PageRank (PR) was a major factor in rankings. Today it is one of hundreds of factors in the algorithm that determines a pages rankings.  |
| Pages per Visit | This tells you the average number of pages that get viewed during each visit. Higher numbers indicate that your visitors read multiple pages before they leave.  |
| Paid Inclusion | Refers to the process of paying a fee to a search engine in order to be included in that search engine or directory. Also known as guaranteed inclusion. Paid inclusion does not impact rankings of a web page; it merely guarantees that the web page itself will be included in the index. These programs were typically used by web sites that were not being fully crawled or were incapable of being crawled, due to dynamic URL structures, frames, etc.  |
| Pay Per Call | A model of paid advertising similar to Pay Per Click (PPC), except advertisers pay for every phone call that comes to them from a search ad, rather than for every click-through to their web site landing page for the ad. Often higher cost than PPC advertising; but valued by advertisers for higher conversion rates from consumers who take the action step of telephoning an advertiser.  |
| Personas | These are people types or sub-groups that encompass several attributes, such as gender, age, location, salary level, leisure activities, lifestyle characteristics, marital / family status or some kind of definable behavior.
