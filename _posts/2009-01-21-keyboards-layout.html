<h2 id="sec-1">Why my keyboard has a QWERTY layout? </h2>

<p>
The most common keyboard layout in use today is called QWERTY, it
takes its name from the first six characters seen in the far left of
the keyboard's top row of letters.

<p>
from Wikipedia:
</p>
<p>
The QWERTY layout was introduced in the 1860s, being used on the
first commercially-successful typewriter, the machine invented by
Christopher Sholes. The QWERTY layout was designed so that successive
keystrokes would alternate between sides of the keyboard so as to
avoid jams. Improvements in typewriter design made key jams less of a
problem.
</p>
<p>
<b>So the mechanical issues of the original typewriters was the main  reason for this layout design.</b>
</p>
<p>
A second popular layout is called Dvorak, designed in the 1930's and
it tries to address another problem:
</p>
<p>
"&hellip;the introduction of the electric typewriter in the 1930s made
typist fatigue more of a problem, leading to increased interest in the
Dvorak layout&hellip;"
</p>
<p>
But even the Dvorak layout is already some years old, so is the
<b>typist fatigue</b> the same as now? Do we write, for example, the same
things as in 1930's?

<p>
Take a look at the texts you write every day, and imagine if changing
the keyboard would make it more practical for you.
</p>
<p>
For example, for this text i had to write the word WHY a lot ;) so if
i had whyrtu instead of qwerty on my keyboard, would be an
improvement&hellip;right? Maybe yes, but there's other things to take
into account, for example:
</p><ul>
<li>
counting ALL of the most used words (not only the why). 
</li>
<li>
key combinations that minimizes vertical finger, because jumping
from 1st to 3rd row, is less efficient than a jump from 1st to 2nd
row.
</li>
<li>
what key combinations minimizes horizontal finger movements?
</li>
<li>
frequent use of pinky, should be minimized, related to the above
horizontal and vertical long movements.
</li>
<li>
etc&hellip; (you can make up your own)
</li>
</ul>


<p>
And then try out several keyboard layouts and variations.
</p>
<p>
Imagining to do this by hand, like Dvorak and Sholes
did for QWERTY is a pain. Luckily we have computers now and as a
matter of fact someone already played around with this problem (which
made think about all this subject in the first place).

<p>
See here for experience: <a href="http://klausler.com/evolved.html">http://klausler.com/evolved.html</a>, and also
the final keyboard layout: <a href="http://klausler.com/evolved.pdf">http://klausler.com/evolved.pdf</a>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1_3">


<p>
I'm not sure that there is THE ultimate and perfect keyboard for
everyone, because:
</p><ul>
<li>
different people use different words.
</li>
<li>
different languages use different words.
</li>
<li>
15 years old person words are different from a 70 years old person
words.
</li>
<li>
use of computer during working hours compared out-of-work working
hours&hellip;
</li>
<li>
etc&hellip;
</li>
</ul>


<p>
So even for you, an optimal keyboard layout would probably change over
time.
</p>
<p>
But imagine a future intelligent computer that can be all the time
analyzing what you write in the keyboard and can auto-adapt itself to
give your own very optimal layout. Not too frequently, of course, you
don' want your keyboard changing every day. But maybe every 3 years is
not so impossible to imagine&hellip;
</p>
<p>
Keyboards of the future should come with blank keys that can be
personalized with the character you want.
</p>
<p>
<b>How would this work is someone changes computer</b>? The keyboard
profile, could be fetched from internet when you login to computer.
</p>
<p>
Another idea, is to have full words on keys, like with your top 5 most
used words.
</p>
<p>
<b>Touch screens</b> with a touch screen there's a whole new level of
layout possibilities, we could make more frequent keys bigger than
others&hellip; play with different keyboard shapes, that can adapt to each
person real hands sizes for example&hellip; etc&hellip; etc&hellip;
