### Deconstruction: 
- Reduce content to its minimal moving parts (deconstruct, simplify, zoom out, distill).
- Start with the outcome; start at the end and work your way backwards
- Viewing the subject from a variety of perspectives 
- Looking at what successful outliers are doing 
- Probing the minds of experts through interviews
- Finding simple commonalities in a domain that can serve as a key to accelerate learning

### Selection: analyse and find the common features (80/20)
- The Minimal Effective Dose (MED): "The lowest volume, the lowest frequency, the fewest changes that get us our desired result."
- The what(material) is more important than the how(method)

### Sequencing: 
- Choose the right order to study / learn the material
- Make it stick first, start with fun and simple

### Stakes: 
- Loose something if miss it

### Compression: one-pager's cheat sheet

- Plan a study/practice schedule that provides the frequency needed to gain competency.

### Encoding: zip  / memorization tricks
