<b>(A)Tipical Day?</b>
</p>
<p>
Its morning, you get to your computer, go check the gmail, ah there's
some some news fotos on web picasa from a friend, lets check them
out&hellip; 
</p>
<p>
Then, whats new today? lets check some rss feeds from the google
reader and by the way, how is the real world doing? lets check the
google news, humm this is interesting, lets do some browsing on
it. Open google search &hellip; 
</p>
<p>
<i>search, search, search &hellip;</i>
</p>
<p>
Lunch time, check gmail again, then the gtalk inside the browser pop's
up with a friend asking how you doing, you make a little talk. 
</p>
<p>
Lets take also a peek at how the stock options doing on google
finance. 
</p>
<p>
<i>search, search, search &hellip;</i>
</p>
<p>
Its late afternoon, you scheduled a dinner and you wonder: exactly
where is that restaurant street?, lets check google maps, (or google
earth for on even cooler experience), you find out exactly where is
the restaurant, even add a placemark&hellip;
</p>
<p>
Get back home from dinner, download you digital camera pictures onto
computer, upload them into web picasa, make a blog post(on google
blogger) showing a picture from that night adding some comments where
you where, and what you did, and who you where with. 
</p>
<p>
Check your mail again, and your friend sent you and youtube video,
lets check that out, and maybe 1, 2, 3&hellip; 10 more &hellip;
</p>
<p>
Besides all these you might also use google for making your home page,
share documents, share a calendar, google analytics for collecting
your web site stats, google desktop search to make fast searches on
your computer? google shopping, google images, etc, etc&hellip;
</p>
<p>
So overall, how many google applications are you using? how much
information does google has or can potentially have about you? 
By the way note that being able to handle this amount of data in a
usable is no easy task but&hellip; we can only imagine &hellip;
</p>
<p>
And actually, from a data mining perspective, this is ideal world
almost, imagine the knowledge collected from all the situation
described above; the searches you do, the photos you make, the places
you look at in the world, where you go, what images you search about,
what you click on, what are your interests, what you blog about, what
news you subscribe, maybe some information on what you work on, and
maybe some information of your school, with google desktop indexing
all documents&hellip;its endless, your agenda, your shopping habits, etc
etc&hellip;
</p>
<p>
Soon, Google knows more about you than you do, imagine the ultimate
google application, where you type the following into the search box:
