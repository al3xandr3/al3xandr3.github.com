Techniques to transform data and interpret data in a useful way.

## Quantify Impact

### I want to
Understand how big is a change.
(i.e.  calculate the relative change)

### How
Lets say a bank raised a rate from 3% to 5%, difference is 2% but is ambiguous to say "the rate was increased by 2%". It looks like a very small increase, from a +2 increase from an original of 3.

- Absolute change was 2% but 

- Relative change (5 - 3) / 3 = 0.66(6), so rate was increased by 66%.

Relative calculation general formula:  (new - reference) / reference


### I want to 
Understand how much is one number bigger than other

You looking at a table of numbers, and comparing 2 numbers, wondering by how much one is bigger than the other ?

- Starting with:
22 out of 4236

- approximate to a rounder number
20 out of 4000
(some precision is lost but depending on application that is often ok)

- take out same number of 0's from each (dividing by 10)
2 out of 400

- divide to get the smaller number to 1, try divide by prime numbers under 10: 2, 3, 5 or 7
(in this case 2)
1 out of 200




## Data Quality: confidence interval

### I want to
Know how confidence is the average im calculating.

### How
When estimating a parameter like a mean from random samples, confidence interval helps quantify uncertainty, giving an interval in which we can expect the value to be most of the time.

## Data Quality: hypothesis testing

### I want to
Make sure the results i got are significant (and not due to chance).

### How

## Data Quality: Get an idea on the dispersion of the data

### I want to
Get an idea on the dispersion of the data, what values are more common, what values are outliers.

### Histogram

Shows the distribution of the data, what are the most (and least) frequent values

### Boxplot

### I want to

- Check if distribution is symmetrical around the average.
- Inspect data for Outliers.

Boxplot also is very useful when comparing 2 data sets directly:

Here is an excel with 2 box plot side by side: [boxplot2.xlsx](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3ypY27pPCJyRk83bDFHUUljRXM/edit?usp=sharing)




### Simulations

### I want to

Simulate the behavior, this can be useful for: 

- Generate random data
- Try to guess what should it look like.
- Predict the future (based on the historical observations)

Sometimes in paper is enough. Paper is costly (especially in time) to run many simulations. To get for example the distribution of the solutions. 
For more than a few executions, use a computer (Excel, Python, Ruby, R, etc...).

Example:

- Given the history of values, what is the expected value in a week?
- Given the history of values, in how many days is expected to reach a certain value ?
- Trying to figure out whether the data im looking is being generated by sampling on visitors or being generated by sampling on visits, do a simulation on paper on what are the expected volumes sizes for each, see which one is closer.
