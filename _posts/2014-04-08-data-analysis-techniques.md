Techniques to transform data and interpret data in a useful way.

## Quantify Impact

### I want to
Understand how big is a change.
(i.e.  calculate the relative change)

### How
Lets say a bank raised a rate from 3% to 5%, difference is 2% but is ambiguous to say "the rate was increased by 2%". It looks like a very small increase, from a +2 increase from an original of 3.

- Absolute change was 2% but 

- Relative change (5 - 3) / 3 = 0.66(6), so rate was increased by 66%.

Relative calculation general formula:  (new - reference) / reference




## Data Quality: confidence interval

When estimating a parameter like a mean from random samples, confidence interval helps quantify uncertainty, giving an interval in which we can expect the value to be most of the time.

## Data Quality: hypothesis testing

### I want to
Make sure the results i got are significant (and not due to chance).

## Data Quality: Get an idea on the dispersion of the data

### I want to
Get an idea on the dispersion of the data, what values are more common, what values are outliers.

### Histogram

Shows the distribution of the data, what are the most (and least) frequent values

### Boxplot

### I want to

- Check if distribution is symmetrical around the average.
- Inspect data for Outliers.

### Simulations

### I want to

Simulate the behaviour, this can be usefull for: 

- Generate random data
- Try to guess what should it look like
- Predict the future (based ont he historical observations)

Sometimes in paper is enough. Paper is costly (especially in time) to run many simulations. To get for example the distribution of the solutions. 
For more than a few executions, use a computer (Excel, Python, Ruby, R, etc...).

Example

Trying to figure out whether the data im looking is being generated by sampling on visitors or being generated by sampling on visits, run a simulation on paper and check what trends are expected.
