## Regular Business Reporting

Part of running a business is to produce regular updates on what the business is doing and how is it trending, week over week, month over month.

Having some tools in place even before the top level numbers reaches the analyst, lets him know ahead what to expect and have some answers ready.

## A change in the Business

1. **Goal**: “What’s going on with the business?, is it trending up or down? and if it changed direction: why is that?”
2. Every insight statement needs to be proven. Imagine that every statement will get questioned with: “What makes you say that? It could be a number of things… have you considered XYZ”.
3. Thus each of the statements need to include a chart/view, that gives high confidence on statement, a proof.

### How to prove it? 

Good thing is, a change of trends, can only be (typically) a handful of things:

> * Seasonality Charts like https://research.fb.com/prophet-forecasting-at-scale/   tells us expected seasonality over a year/month/week upfront, thus is very straightforward to tell what seasonality effect is coming up next.

## What to Report

Besides the regular chart, of the trending of the business KPI's, consider also other potentially insightful views, like the [Funnel of the Customer lifecycle](http://al3xandr3.github.io/user-lifecycle-analytics-framework.html):
