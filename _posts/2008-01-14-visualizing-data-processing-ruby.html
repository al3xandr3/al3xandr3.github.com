title: Visualizing Data, with Processing and JRuby
---



<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
In order to learn a bit about data visualization and also learn about
simple data warehousing, i've tried out a small experiment, where i
set out to build an small app for visualizing data.
</p>
<p>
I planned the following:
</p>
<p>
<img src="/img/vis-mmap.png" alt="/img/vis-mmap.png" />
</p>
<p>
The goal is to create a visualization to show the amount of
vegetarians around the world.
</p>
<p>
It goes like this, imagine looking at world map, with each
country showing the number of vegetarians, you
should be able to zoom in to europe for example, to see which
country leads vegetarian eating or zoom out and see the whole world
picture, click on a specific country and see the statistics for that
country for a full month, or choose a particular day of month to
visualize the whole world on that day. Also is desired map like
navigation, were is possible to drag the map around, zoom in and out.
</p>
<p>
On the technical side, as i was interested in using Processing
framework and because I am a ruby addict, this turned out to be a good
excuse to play with jruby.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-1_1">part i, Aggregating Data </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1_1">


<p>
Normally this process involves a lot of work, but i had a shortcut,
i was able to collect clean data from another database. I'm interested in
the table with vegetarian people. But what to collect? what to
summarize/aggregate? what to calculate ?
</p>
<p>
<i>NOTE:</i> Specify up front what is the goal of the visualization as much
as possible, this will influence the way all design will be done. I
had to repeat initial steps a couple of times as the visualization
ideas developed, like re-agregating all the data and calculate new
fields.
</p>
<p>
So in an warehouse fashion lets choose the facts and dimensions:
</p>
<p>
Facts:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
number of vegetarians.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
Dimensions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Time.
</li>
<li>
Localization(country).
</li>
</ul>


<p>
<i>facts:</i> are generally numeric data that captures specific values.
</p>
<p>
<i>dimensions:</i> contain the reference information that gives each
transaction its context. When dimensions are created they should be
as enriched with most information as possible (and calculated
values).
</p>
<p>
Next Step is to build the warehouse, for this is used a plain
database where i created 3 tables:
</p>
<p>
<img src="/img/vis-dw.png" alt="/img/vis-dw.png" />
</p>
<p>
<b>Dimension Country:</b>
</p>
<p>
Initially i only had 2 char ISO code identifying country, but i
enriched the dimension with all the other values.
</p>
<p>
I used geoname.org webservice to collect other values. Specially
important are the geo coordinates for the country bounding box which
where used to calculate central latitude and a central longitude of a
country, that is going to be used for the visualization.
</p>
<p>
Things like continent, population, capital, are can be used later for
summarizing data for continent, for showing ratio of number of
vegetarians for total of population, number of vegetarians for square
meter, etc, etc&hellip; think of the possibilities&hellip; :)
</p>
<p>
<b>Dimension Time:</b>
</p>
<p>
Made the finest granularity detail as a day.
Then from a day, we can calculate, day, month, year, day of week,
weekday?, day in year, day in month, quarter, week day name, etc
etc&hellip;
</p>
<p>
What is this useful for? Well imagine you want to see number of
vegetarians on wendenesday's compared to monday's, or the same for
quarters, or months, maybe getting close to summer months, the number
of veggies might go up a bit ?

<p>
With the basic schema laid-out, its time for data collection. I used
the ActiveRecord part of the rails framework, using jruby.
Its not the first time i've used ActiveRecord as standalone and i
like it a lot&hellip; simplifies data access hugely, and because its all
inside ruby, i  get the added bonus of doing some calculations that
would be much harder in pure sql.
These collected and calculated values are then inserted into a local
mySql using the schema above: fact<sub>vegetarian</sub>, dim<sub>date</sub> and
dim<sub>country</sub>.
</p>
<p>
I've collected values for a whole month.
</p>
<p>
Resulted in 225 lines of code for the warehouse part code, with some
comments&hellip; but no repeated code.

<h3 id="sec-1_2">part ii, Building a Visualizer </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1_2">


<p>
The visualizer is a cycle that refreshes the interface, on each cycle
the database is queried, with a set of filters, like view, date,
country. The filters are updated when user clicks on the interface.
Like clicking on US, will set the the filter country to US, on the
next refresh data for US is obtained and the interface updated
accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Application was divided into different drawing components:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Show World Data, its the opening scenario, showing the whole world
for a 1 month's period.
</li>
<li>
Show Country, used showing a specific country stats.
</li>
<li>
Show Stats, a strip at bottom showing a graph of the number of
vegetarians per day, over a month's perdiod.
</li>
<li>
Show Buttons, button used to control zoom, reset, etc&hellip;
</li>
</ul>


<p>
(Probably a refactoring will reduce the Show World Map and the Show
Country into a single Drawing component, has a lot of repeated code.)
</p>
<p>
I've created a different module for each one, which were then mixed
into main class the inherits from Processing.Sketch.
</p>
<p>
Made some stuff clickable:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
country codes, displayed on top of the countries, so the user has
the possibility to filter and see stats on bottom of a single
country. This is done by identifying which country coordinates is
closer to the mouse coordinates.
</li>
<li>
Also on the bottom, the stats strip has on the x axis the possibility
to click on the day of the month, so the user can select a particular
day and that will update the world visualization, showing the numbers
of the number of vegetarians for a given day for all the world.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
ANd here's what it looks like:
</p>
<p>
<img src="/img/vis-visual.png" alt="/img/vis-visual.png" />
</p>
<p>
When Zoomed in, and showing Portugal stats on the bottom:
</p>
<p>
<img src="/img/vis-visual-zoom.png" alt="/img/vis-visual-zoom.png" />
</p>

<p>
Ended up with 584 lines of code, with a big chunk of repeated code, on
the visualization part.
</p>
<p>
Overall making the visualization was a lot more work that the
warehouse part, because I had a lot of fighting around with correct
coordinates positioning, getting a decent map, maintaining map country
coordinates with the zooms.
</p>
<p>
Using jruby was mostly a nice experience, there are a couple of things
to learn at first, for example on how to include java libraries, no
biggie, but I had also a type conversion issue when i tried to
refactor the code at some point, i guess its because of the java
type's, that jruby guys hide and convert automatically &hellip; but most
likelly its because of my inexperience with jruby&hellip;
</p>
<p>
I've used version 1.0 of jruby, i think is a great work that jruby
guys have done, making accessible to ruby community all the millions
of java libraries out there. But of course don't expect to do 100%
ruby code like you do with old ruby, sometimes there's some java
lurking out of the jruby box.

<h3 id="sec-1_3">the Good </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1_3">


<p>
Well, its very cool to be able to use ruby for Drawing. Gives power
that regular ruby does not have. 
Exists huge amount of libraries, to use with it.
Connection to Java is indeed very powerful.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-1_4">the Bad </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1_4">


<p>
Visualizations are hard to get right, and ended up of having code
repeated and all over the place. Why? Well partly because im a newbie
in jRuby, but partly because Processing seems to fit better for small
Sketch visualizations.

<h3 id="sec-1_5">Ideas </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1_5">


<p>
Is it possible to do a little architecture around it?, to make it a
bit better, isolating all drawing stuff.
</p>

<p>
<b>Processing</b>
</p>
<p>
Processing is great, has also huge potential, had a couple of troubles
with 1 or 2 plugins i tried, but i end up using base distribution and
that works and feels 100%. I look forward to do more stuff with
it, its fun!
