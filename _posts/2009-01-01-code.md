## Stocks price monitor

Waiting for a stock price to rise to a certain value to sell it? or waiting for the price to drop to a certain value to buy it? But don't want to be checking it every day? Here's a little automation that check it for you.

This script will send you an email when stock price is outside the defined thresholds.

Also, have done before [the same in ruby](http://al3xandr3.github.io/stock-price-alert.html).

## Picsort - Picture organizer

After downloading photos from a camera, this application organizes the pictures into folders, so that you/me don't have to do that manually. 

Also, have done [the same in ruby and in python](https://github.com/al3xandr3/picsort).

## In Page Debug tool

A visual debug tool to inspect custom tracking code placed in the different html elements of a web page, to ease the debugging of web analytics tracking code.

The general solution of injecting javascript into a page from a bookmark, is very usefull for many applications, especially if when combined with javascript online hosting, i explain most of the solution i used in [javascript bookmarks](/javascript-bookmarks.html).

## Table.query (aka R's sqldf in Ruby)

A small library that given a set of data it transparently inserts it into a sqlite database and then allows for very flexible querying (SQL). Usefull for ad-hoc data tasks that read data from some file or api that require quick analysis. Adding data into a sqlite database will also allow for the data to be bigger than memory can fit. Inspired by R's [**sqldf**](http://code.google.com/p/sqldf/).

## Dashboard Builder

A framework for building up interactive html dashboards in ruby. Contains implementation of both simple & multivariate regression for visualizing trends, supports fetching email attachments / content as data sources, allows for posting the end result onto a confluence wiki page.

## Linear & Logistic Regression

A collection of exercises from the OpenClassRoom machine learning classes.
Serve as a reference in implementing linear and logistic regression with some added debugging features in R.

 * linear regression: [web][3]
 * multivariate linear regression: [web][5]
 * logistic regression and Newton's method: [web][7]
 * regularized linear regression: [web][9]
 * regularized logistic regression: [web][11]

## cov3 - Custom Web Crawler

A clojure, selenium based web crawler with a couple of variations that i found useful. Cov3 crawls pages with the intention of executing
(javascript)tests / validations on each of the pages it opens. The original idea of a web crawler is that given an initial page it keeps on following all links it finds in the same domain until all pages are visited. I added a couple of variations: Given a sitemap.xml it randomly samples part of it(useful for big sitemaps) and follows those urls executing some test. And another option is a csv file, with the urls and tests to execute on each.

## jQuery Twitter 'mini' plugin

A jQuery plugin to display a twitter feed on a web page(blog for example). The twitter api feed, i found, has an annoying particularity of not always returning the requested number of tweets, so i added a feature that until it gets the right amount of messages it keeps on fetching. Thats useful when you want to fill a web page space with exactly 3 messages. Also included a "time ago" date calculations based of john resig [code][15], with an added local timezone shift.

## The Daily Extract

Scripts that automate the process of aggregating data in a database,
extracting it, outputting results into csv files and sending them over by sftp. Very feature rich: task list queue, full logging, email reports, sql templating, sftp support, extract volume validation, unit testing. And with a strong convention over configuration theme.

In Aug 2009 i did a somewhat similar 2nd version of the daily extract, but this time using clojure, with added features: web front end for task queue manipulation, statistics on extracted volumes and sqlite for storing the task list queue and statistics over time.
