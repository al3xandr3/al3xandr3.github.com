## Stock - Stock price monitor

Waiting for a stock price to rise to a certain value to sell it? or waiting for the price to drop to a certain value to buy it? But don't want to be checking it every day? Here's a little automation that check it for you.

This script will send you an email when stock price is outside the defined thresholds.

## In Page Debug tool

A visual debug tool to inspect custom tracking code placed in the different html elements of a web page, to ease the debugging of web analytics tracking code.

The general solution of injecting javascript into a page from a bookmark, is very usefull for many applications, especially if when combined with javascript online hosting, i explain most of the solution i used in [javascript bookmarks](http://al3xandr3.github.io/2012/12/05/javascript-bookmarks.html).

## Dashboard Builder

A framework for building up interactive html dashboards in ruby. Contains
implementation of both simple & multivariate regression for visualizing
trends, supports fetching email attachments / content as data sources, allows
for posting the end result onto a confluence wiki page.

## Linear & Logistic Regression

A collection of exercises from the OpenClassRoom machine learning classes.
Serve as a reference in implementing linear and logistic regression with some
added debugging features in R.

## cov3 - Custom Web Crawler

A clojure, selenium based web crawler with a couple of variations that i found
useful. Cov3 crawls pages with the intention of executing
(javascript)tests / validations on each of the pages it opens. The original idea
of a web crawler is that given an initial page it keeps on following all links
it finds in the same domain until all pages are visited. I added a couple of
variations: Given a sitemap.xml it randomly samples part of it(useful for big
sitemaps) and follows those urls executing some test. And another option is a
csv file, with the urls and tests to execute on each.

## jQuery Twitter 'mini' plugin

A jQuery plugin to display a twitter feed on a web page(blog for example). The
twitter api feed, i found, has an annoying particularity of not always
returning the requested number of tweets, so i added a feature that until it
gets the right amount of messages it keeps on fetching. Thats useful when you
want to fill a web page space with exactly 3 messages. Also included a "time
ago" date calculations based of john resig [code][15], with an added local
timezone shift.

## The Daily Extract

Scripts that automate the process of aggregating data in a database,
extracting it, outputting results into csv files and sending them over by
sftp. Very feature rich: task list queue, full logging, email reports, sql
templating, sftp support, extract volume validation, unit testing. And with a
strong convention over configuration theme.

In Aug 2009 i did a somewhat similar 2nd version of the daily extract, but
this time using clojure, with added features: web front end for task queue
manipulation, statistics on extracted volumes and sqlite for storing the task
list queue and statistics over time.
