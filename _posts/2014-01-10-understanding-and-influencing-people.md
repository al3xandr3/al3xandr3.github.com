> Someone was so rude just now, i'm going to be rude back! No, wait, probably has nothing to do with you, think instead why that was: stress? misunderstanding? culture gap?

## Categorizing people in 4 areas

Take this with a grain of salt, is a strong simplification / model. Models are always wrong, but can be usefull if applied to right situation.

Every person has always a bit of each category, but some people will be more heavy on a particular one, or even in 2.

- red: think angry, ready for an argument, writes in CAPS LOCK, power, control, apprach you very directly
- yellow: think sun, happy, enthusiast, positive, friendly, extroverted
- green: think grounded, calm, caring, democratic, desire for understanding, supporter, helper
- blue: think blueprint, numbers, facts, very analytical, all about the numbers, not emotional, introverted.
