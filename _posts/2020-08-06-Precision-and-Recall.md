Notes on interpretation of model evaluation measures: Precision and Recall.

## On Recall

Recall helps when the cost of false negatives is high.
A False negative is when you predict no, but is actually yes.

A False negative is when you decide to ignore the sound of a twig breaking in a dark forest, and you get eaten by a bear.
Humans have high recall rates regarding survival
Prefer to be wrong more often but always check.


## On Precision

Precision helps when the costs of false positives are high
false positive is when you predict yes, but is actually a no.

If we have a model that has very low precision, then many patients will be told that they have covid, and that will include some misdiagnoses and loads of extra stress and tests are at stake.
Gods are saying that a sacrifice will help with the crops, are we really sure? this is a costly mistake to make.
Prefer to only commit when super sure.
