<ol>
<li>
You plugin the AB testing tool to your application and say:
optimize page A, on the measurable goal X (for example
downloads).
</li>
</ol>


<ol>
<li>
The Tool Optimizes: new UI variation -&gt; tests it -&gt; analyses
results -&gt; makes it default -&gt; creates new UI variation -&gt;
tests it -&gt; etc&hellip; This goes ad eternum&hellip; Much like natural
evolution, keeps experimenting/mutating, until it finds the best
combinations.
</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
New UI variations do not need(shouldn't even) be 100%
random, they should use smarter techniques like: genetic(and other
search/optimization) algorithms + tried out design heuristics +
branding guidelines(avoid color A, use font B, etc..) +
(sampled)user filtering + some amount of randomness + etc..
</li>
<li>
Knowledge Base: Build a Database with the test results, that
collects knowledge of what worked and what didn't (for a given
context). Just as Pandora collects user input for building its
recomendation system, this accumulated knowledge would serve as
input for the task of generating the new UI variations.
<i>Note:</i> The amount of data is key; the bigger the amount of test
results, the closer to all possible variations thus the closer to
all the best optimizations. With a large amount of test and tried
out results quicky we would get the perfect UI rules.
</li>
<li>
Page Flow: Tool should optimize not only the page itself, but also
navigation along pages, customizing content depending on the flow
For example, forward the user to a different page, depending
on the keyword used in a search engine when arriving at the
website.
</li>
<li>
Personalized UI: What works for user A might not work for B. A 16
years old likes different things than a 50 years old. Even for a
unique user, his tastes changes over over  time: winter vs summer,
week vs weekend, working hours vs non-working hours etc&hellip; So the
perfect interface might need to be changing over time(? Don't
assume, experiment and see if it works&hellip;).
