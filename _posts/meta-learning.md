### Deconstruction: 
start with the outcome(start zoomed out and then start zooming in)
viewing the subject from a variety of perspectives 
looking at what successful outliers are doing 
probing the minds of experts through interviews 
finding simple commonalities in a domain that can serve as a key to accelerate learning

### Selection: analyse and find the common features (80/20)
the Minimal Effective Dose (MED): “The lowest volume, the lowest frequency, the fewest changes that get us our desired result.”
the what is more inportant than the how

### Sequencing: 
make it stick first, start with fun and simple

### Stakes: 
loose something if miss it

### Compression: one-pager's cheat sheet
the Prescriptive One-Pager lists rules or principles that help you generate real-world examples.
The Practice One-Pager lists real-world examples to practice, which helps you learn the principles indirectly.

### Frequency: breaks / intensity(immersion) / expected progression
Plan a study/practice schedule that provides the frequency needed to gain competency.

### Encoding: zip  / memorization tricks
Find ways to associate the knowledge and skills with what you already know.

### Other lists
  - Reduce content to its minimal moving parts (what this means?)
  - Stop and look at the goals and objectives from a variety of perspectives
  - Turn content on its head; start at the end and work your way backwards
  - Speak to experts who gained mastery in nontraditional ways
  - Observe experts for their implicit knowledge
  - Consider which 20% of skills will provide 80% of the desired outcomes
  - Distill, distill, distill
  - Provide study and performance support in simple one-pagers
