A Mental model is an insights that you can apply to new situations. For example gravity, you know that if you fall down it is going to hurt, or that pushing something heavy uphill is harder than on flat ground, etc...
Popularized by Charlie Munger (investment wizard), as a way to better evaluate situations and make better decisions a.k.a. practical wisdom.
It applies to all areas, from human psychology to money investment.

 Charlie Munger summed up the approach to practical wisdom through understanding mental models by saying: “Well, the first rule is that you can’t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts and try and bang ’em back. If the facts don’t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don’t have them in a usable form. You’ve got to have models in your head. And you’ve got to array your experience both vicarious and direct on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.”
