## Motivation

Data Analysts job
- Understand 'complete' reality of Biz and Product 
- Did it help to work towards top level goals (June16. MAU: 325M, Reachable: 500M)
- "Learn not measure"
an organization make better decisions by surfacing the truth on the 






## Data in Practice

### Stage 1
Context, what we do etcâ€¦
Choose kpis
Train org to be data driven, they need to know the goals are to be followed
Set goals
Monitor the goals
Do predictions (some modeling needed) - side project!



### Stage 2 and Forward
Once stage 1 is set up, then help org get to the goals
Understand what we can change what we are doing wrong, with basis on data
AB test changes to find improvements
New product / features that bring new value to company




## Tackling data asks

Questions to ask, when a data requests comes in:

What: The ask
Why: The hypothesis on yearly goals impact (or learning)
How: 
  1. (is the data IN part sorted?) Where are the Spec's ? 
  2. Is this an Ad-hoc analysis or recurring dashboard*
When: is there a hard deadline / a launch date ?



## Publishing numbers publicly

When publishing numbers publicly, publish also the definitions of the metrics, otherwise is hard to tell what they trully represent. And impossible to compare to the metrics of other companies.

In the finance world this is solved, for example, revenue, profit have very precise definitions.



## Data Science Techniques


- Classification: biz user or not?
- Regression: what results we getting in 3 months if this continues
- Similarity matching: avoid spamming everybody? Send an email to a cohort, for the ones that respond, do a similarities matching find the users of with same type, send email to them. 2nd idea, find what other product skype users have, find their similarities, send to similar group a suggestion to try same products. Churn analysis find the ones in risk of leaving, reach out to them.
- Clustering what characteristics have our most engaged user base has?
- Profiling: aka behavior description, if a MAU is deviating his behavior, maybe we could reach out to him
- Link prediction, recommendations, friend of a friend
- Data reduction
- Ab testing

Skype

- Comparing cohorts framework, almost like ab testing framework. Should calculate if cohorts have enough confidence.
- Goals dashboards, with prediction line, and warn when something is changing direction.
- Biz users classification






## OLD


What is a data job in an organization? it can have several applications, but the business Analytics goals:

- Understand 'complete' reality of Biz and Product.
- Be clear on what are the org goals. Always put data analysis into context of the org goals.
- 'Learn not measure'. Pumping out dashboard does not translate directly into usefullness to company, we should always ask, what we learned, what can we do ?
- Work on the things that might bring the most return to the company, the most important.

That requires a couple of specific initiatives to best make it work:

1. Learn the domain and ecosystem: activities exist, what products, what are the end goals:   usage, money, user count, downloads, etc...

2. Who are the stakeholders, that can act on recommendations, and their understanding on   stats.

3. Define the metrics framework and the KPIs. What indicators are important to keep an eye on. Based on the company goals.

3.1. Be curious with the data, ask good questions, explore ideas, correlations.

4. Data 1st step: Build a daily / weekly report, with what happened. With drill-down levels:   
    - level.1: sales change
    - level.2: what products changed the most
    - level.3: what countries sales changed more, etc... (Level.1 some say should be up to 3 KPIs mac). (this exercise might also   reveal gaps with data infrastructure)

5. Data 2nd step: Actionable insights (recommendations) for each stakeholder. Guidance, and this will vary by stakeholder role.

5.1. AB testing / Optimize - test changes and see how impact bottom line KPIs.

5.2. Prediction Models can help see where we headed.
